Per the discussion [1] about a problem with how vfio-ccw calculates
the length of a channel program (specifically when using the
forthcoming QEMU BIOS code for DASD IPL), I present this fix.

Patch 1 fixes the problem, and is over-engineered
for readability sake.

Patch 2 takes the functions from Patch 1, and refactors the
existing code to make other areas a little easier to understand.
(I hope.)

I've been running fio for over 24 hours now, and have seen
zero hours.  Previously, I would have probably seen "a few"
errors by now, where prior to the original fix I would've seen
"many" errors.  Further tests are still ongoing.
