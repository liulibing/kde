Primary purpose of this patch series is to improve tap13 output to be
fit for CI purposes. While almost ready to submit, stumbled upon a
glitch in the most recently added support for specifying desired tests
on the command line, so added another patch to fix that up.


v2:
Patch 1:
- Added the more elaborate patch description that got somehow lost in
  my inital post
- Output tap13 as the testcases progress instead of once at the end.
  Note: Tried to use flock() for the locking required, but that didn't
        really help to protect a file against concurrent access. Went
        for a surprisingly simple approach that does the job as well.

Patch 2:
- Again, a piece got lost on the initial version, whereby desired tests
  specified on the command line would get lost. Fixed.



Stefan Raspl (2):
  tap13: list testcases individually
  run_tests: fix command line options handling
