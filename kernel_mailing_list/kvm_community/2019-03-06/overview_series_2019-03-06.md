#### [PATCH 1/2] KVM: Implement kvm_copy_guest() to perform copy of guest memory in place
##### From: Suraj Jitindar Singh <sjitindarsingh@gmail.com>

```c
Implement the function kvm_copy_guest() to be used to perform a memory
copy from one guest physical address to another of a variable length.

This performs similar functionality as the kvm_read_guest() and
kvm_write_guest() functions, except both addresses point to guest memory.
This performs a copy in place using raw_copy_in_user() to avoid having to
buffer the data.

The guest memory can reside in different memslots and the copy length
can span memslots.

I suspect additional checking may be required around the raw_copy_in_user()
call.

#### [PATCH] KVM: arm: VGIC: properly initialise private IRQ affinity
##### From: Andre Przywara <andre.przywara@arm.com>

```c
At the moment we initialise the target *mask* of a virtual IRQ to the
VCPU it belongs to, even though this mask is only defined for GICv2 and
quickly runs out of bits for many GICv3 guests.
This behaviour triggers an UBSAN complaint for more than 32 VCPUs:
------
[ 5659.462377] UBSAN: Undefined behaviour in virt/kvm/arm/vgic/vgic-init.c:223:21
[ 5659.471689] shift exponent 32 is too large for 32-bit type 'unsigned int'
------
Also for GICv3 guests the reporting of TARGET in the "vgic-state" debugfs
dump is wrong, due to this very same problem.

Fix both issues by only initialising vgic_irq->targets for a vGICv2 guest,
and by initialising vgic_irq->mpdir for vGICv3 guests instead. We can't
use the actual MPIDR for that, as the VCPU's system register is not
initialised at this point yet. This is not really an issue, as ->mpidr
is just used for the debugfs output and the IROUTER MMIO register, which
does not exist in redistributors (dealing with SGIs and PPIs).

#### [RFC][Patch v9 1/6] KVM: Guest free page hinting support
##### From: Nitesh Narayan Lal <nitesh@redhat.com>

```c
This patch adds the following:
1. Functional skeleton for the guest implementation. It enables the
guest to maintain the PFN of head buddy free pages of order
FREE_PAGE_HINTING_MIN_ORDER (currently defined as MAX_ORDER - 1)
in a per-cpu array.
Guest uses guest_free_page_enqueue() to enqueue the free pages post buddy
merging to the above mentioned per-cpu array.
guest_free_page_try_hinting() is used to initiate hinting operation once
the collected entries of the per-cpu array reaches or exceeds
HINTING_THRESHOLD (128). Having larger array size(MAX_FGPT_ENTRIES = 256)
than HINTING_THRESHOLD allows us to capture more pages specifically when
guest_free_page_enqueue() is called from free_pcppages_bulk().
For now guest_free_page_hinting() just resets the array index to continue
capturing of the freed pages.
2. Enables the support for x86 architecture.

#### [PATCH 2/2] KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Implement virtual mode H_PAGE_INIT handler
##### From: Suraj Jitindar Singh <sjitindarsingh@gmail.com>

```c
Implement a virtual mode handler for the H_CALL H_PAGE_INIT which can be
used to zero or copy a guest page. The page is defined to be 4k and must
be 4k aligned.

The in-kernel handler halves the time to handle this H_CALL compared to
handling it in userspace.

#### [PATCH v2] vsock/virtio: fix kernel panic from virtio_transport_reset_no_sock

```c
Previous to commit 22b5c0b63f32 ("vsock/virtio: fix kernel panic
after device hot-unplug"), vsock_core_init() was called from
virtio_vsock_probe(). Now, virtio_transport_reset_no_sock() can be called
before vsock_core_init() has the chance to run.

#### [PATCH] vhost: silence an unused-variable warning
##### From: Arnd Bergmann <arnd@arndb.de>

```c
On some architectures, the MMU can be disabled, leading to access_ok()
becoming an empty macro that does not evaluate its size argument,
which in turn produces an unused-variable warning:

drivers/vhost/vhost.c:1191:9: error: unused variable 's' [-Werror,-Wunused-variable]
        size_t s = vhost_has_feature(vq, VIRTIO_RING_F_EVENT_IDX) ? 2 : 0;

Mark the variable as __maybe_unused to shut up that warning.
