[This is the Linux kernel part, git tree is available at
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/kvms390/vfio-ccw.git vfio-ccw-eagain-caps-v3

The companion QEMU patches are available at
https://github.com/cohuck/qemu vfio-ccw-caps]

Currently, vfio-ccw only relays START SUBCHANNEL requests to the real
device. This tends to work well for the most common 'good path' scenarios;
however, as we emulate {HALT,CLEAR} SUBCHANNEL in QEMU, things like
clearing pending requests at the device is currently not supported.
This may be a problem for e.g. error recovery.

This patch series introduces capabilities (similar to what vfio-pci uses)
and exposes a new async region for handling hsch/csch.

Lightly tested (I can interact with a dasd as before, and reserve/release
seems to work well.) Not sure if there is a better way to test this, ideas
welcome.

Changes v3->v4:
- shrunk the capability offset, we don't need to accommodate as much as pci
- make checks in patch 1 more consistent and less buggy
- rebased on top of my current vfio-ccw branch

Changes v2->v3:
- Unb0rked patch 1, improved scope
- Split out the new mutex from patch 2 into new patch 3; added missing
  locking and hopefully improved description
- Patch 2 now reworks the state handling by splitting the BUSY state
  into CP_PROCESSING and CP_PENDING
- Patches 3 and 5 adapted on top of the reworked patches; hsch/csch
  are allowed in CP_PENDING, but not in CP_PROCESSING (did not add
  any R-b due to that)
- Added missing free in patch 5
- Probably some small changes I forgot to note down

Changes v1->v2:
- New patch 1: make it safe to use the cp accessors at any time; this
  should avoid problems with unsolicited interrupt handling
- New patch 2: handle concurrent accesses to the io region; the idea is
  to return -EAGAIN to userspace more often (so it can simply retry)
- also handle concurrent accesses to the async io region
- change VFIO_REGION_TYPE_CCW
- merge events for halt and clear to a single async event; this turned out
  to make the code quite a bit simpler
- probably some small changes I forgot to note down
